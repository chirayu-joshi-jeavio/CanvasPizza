# Canvas in Android

Canvas is used to draw shapes, paths, complex animations, create games, etc.

It is supported across most of the frameworks.

Many libraries for chart and graphs use canvas to plot the data. And we can customise those 
libraries by overriding default canvas implementation.


## Basic shapes and graphics
- drawLine(...)
- drawPath(...)
- drawRect(...)
- drawRoundedRect(...)
- drawCircle(...)
- drawOval(...)
- drawArc(...)
- drawPoints(...)
- drawText(...)
- drawImage(...)
